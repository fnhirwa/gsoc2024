Thanks for following this link, I am going to walk you through my GSoC2024 experience and the project that I worked on under [sktime]() organization.

## Project Title

Scaling PyTorch backend and Darts integration

## Overview

[sktime](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/) is a Unified framework for machine learning with time series, that uses an interactive Python interpreter and supports various machine learning tasks including forecasting, time series classification, regression and clustering.

I spent the whole summer working on the mission of unifying machine learning with time series under the project entitled **Scaling backends, foundation models, PyTorch, darts and pytorch-forecasting with sktime.** Where I mainly worked on integrating the darts Regression models, PyTorch implemented classification models, and deep diving into the structure of deep learning interface of sktime, debugging errors and suggesting improvements to the interface. Despite working on the project mentioned above my contributions went to regural software development lifecycle including the bugs fixing in the repository and improvement of development workflow such as implementing linting standards.

### Generally my contribution yielded the following outcomes

* My community engagement made me learn a lot of new skills, and the team working spirit among the organization led to the successful completion of the project.
* Communicating with my mentors made me grow on a proffessional level and gave me a taste on how working on impactful project should feel.
* Solving complex bugs made me take enough time to deep dive into the codebase and gave me a quick understanding of the sktime code base.
* The whole program boosted personal confidence to the level that I wish to mentor open-source contributors in the future projects.
* Learned about a new machine Learning library(darts).
* Continued support for open-source through my contributions.

### Technical outcomes of the project

* Completed

    - Integration of the darts regression models adapter: [Pull Request](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/6454)

* In Progress
    - Implementation of GRU-based time series classifiers: [Pull Request](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/6952)
    - Migration of MCNN classifier from `sktime-dl` to `sktime`: [Pull Request](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/6763)

## Work Done

### Darts Regression models adapter adapter

With sktime now one can quickly interface the darts library. As mentioned from the darts documentation it provides user-friendly forecasting and anomaly detection on time series through various models, and initially the implementation of the regression models adapter in sktime now gives the capability to interface all available regression models from darts that are: [RegressionModel](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.regression_model.html#darts.models.forecasting.regression_model.RegressionModel), [LinearRegressionModel](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.linear_regression_model.html#darts.models.forecasting.linear_regression_model.LinearRegressionModel), and [XGBModel](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.xgboost.html#darts.models.forecasting.xgboost.XGBModel), yet remaining models [LightGBMModel](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.lgbm.html#darts.models.forecasting.lgbm.LightGBMModel), [RandomForest](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.random_forest.html#darts.models.forecasting.random_forest.RandomForest) and [CatBoostModel](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.catboost_model.html#darts.models.forecasting.catboost_model.CatBoostModel) needs an implementation classes as the adapter for these models is already implemented.

* **Challenges and takeaways during implementation**

    Getting this pull request merged took a lot of efforts as initially when implementing the adapter there were strange errors on the CI, and handling the dependencies inside `sktime` was problematic initially. After a thorough investigation the main issue was how sktime installs `OSX` dependencies on CI and the [pull request](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/6926) to resolve this issue which addresses the installation of `libomp` and setting the compiler flags properly made it possible to test this adapter on macos runners.

    There was another issue on how darts handles dataset indexes differently from sktime and resolving this took some efforts as I had to implement custom functions to handle such cases.

    This task equiped me with the skill of diving into complex issues ranging from regular implementation to the testing environment.
