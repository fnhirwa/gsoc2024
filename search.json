    "text": "Overview\nsktime is a Unified framework for machine learning with time series, that uses an interactive Python interpreter and supports various machine learning tasks including forecasting, time series classification, regression and clustering.\nI spent the whole summer working on the mission of unifying machine learning with time series under the project entitled Scaling backends, foundation models, PyTorch, darts and pytorch-forecasting with sktime Where I mainly worked on integrating the darts Regression models, PyTorch implemented classification models, and deep diving into the structure of deep learning interface of sktime, debugging errors and suggesting improvements to the interface. Despite working on the project mentioned above my contributions went to regural software development lifecycle including the bugs fixing in the repository and improvement of development workflow such as implementing linting standards.\n\nGenerally my contribution yielded the following outcomes\n\nMy community engagement made me learn a lot of new skills, and the team working spirit among the organization led to the successful completion of the project.\nCommunicating with my mentors made me grow on a proffessional level and gave me a taste on how working on impactful project should feel.\nSolving complex bugs made me take enough time to deep dive into the codebase and gave me a quick understanding of the sktime code base.\nThe whole program boosted personal confidence to the level that I wish to mentor open-source contributors in the future projects.\nLearned about a new machine Learning library(darts).\nContinued support for open-source through my contributions.\n\n\n\nTechnical outcomes of the project\n\nCompleted\n\nIntegration of the darts regression models adapter: Pull Request\n\nIn Progress\n\nImplementation of GRU-based time series classifiers: Pull Request\nMigration of MCNN classifier from sktime-dl to sktime: Pull Request\n\nOther Merged Pull Requests\n\nFix the colalign functionality to ScipyDist class as specified in the docstrings\nFix the docs local build failure due to corrupt notebook\nFix ForecastX when forecaster_X_exogeneous=“complement”\nFix HolidayFeatures crashes if dataframe doesn’t contain specified date\nSwitch to ruff as linting tool\nAdd non-unicode characters check to the linter\nResolve the issue with diacritics failing to be decoded on Windows"

As mentioned from the darts documentation it provides user-friendly forecasting and anomaly detection on time series through various models, and initially the implementation of the regression models adapter in sktime now gives the capability to interface all available regression models from darts that are: RegressionModel, LinearRegressionModel, and XGBModel, yet remaining models LightGBMModel, RandomForest and CatBoostModel needs an implementation classes as the adapter for these models is already implemented.\n\nChallenges and takeaways during implementation\nGetting this pull request merged took a lot of efforts as initially when implementing the adapter there were strange errors on the CI, and handling the dependencies inside sktime was problematic initially. After a thorough investigation the main issue was how sktime installs OSX dependencies on CI and the pull request to resolve this issue which addresses the installation of libomp and setting the compiler flags properly made it possible to test this adapter on macos runners.\nThere was another issue on how darts handles dataset indexes differently from sktime and resolving this took some efforts as I had to implement custom functions to handle such cases.\nThis task equiped me with the skill of diving into complex issues ranging from regular implementation to the testing environment.\n\nThe examples showcasing the use of darts models with sktime can be found in this notebook"

This means that even though my GSoC period is coming to an end I will continue to contribute to the sktime project and interacting with the community."
